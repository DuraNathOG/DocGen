# Drawing Approval — Sign Against Existing Record PDFs — Plan

> **Branch:** `feat/drawing-pdf-merge` (off `main` @ v3.57.0, `62183ca`)
> **Status:** DRAFT / RFC — design pending maintainer agreement on #412. Successor to closed PR #197 (`exp/document-markup`, closed as dormant 2026-08-10).
> **Related:** #405 (template-defined supplemental PDFs — same concept, generation only), #407 (guided page fails open to the server re-render), #413 (signing page renders below screen resolution; no zoom), #373 / #404 (sender UI work in flight).
> **How to use this doc:** decisions in §4 are _proposed_ until the RFC is agreed. Work milestones in order; tick boxes and leave a one-line note on anything that changes.

## 1. Use case

A record carries one or more **existing PDFs** — engineering drawings (A1 and A3, landscape, AutoCAD / SOLIDWORKS / Adobe exports). We want to send them to an **external customer via the normal emailed signing link** so the customer can **approve (sign) or decline (with reason)**. A later milestone (M2) lets the customer **redline** the drawings.

Two shapes, both required (measured on a real issue set, §5.2):

- **Many single-sheet files per approval.** Document control on CDE-managed projects (high-rise, rail) forbids multi-page PDFs, so one approval can cover **dozens** of ~1 MB single-sheet files (sample: 14 × A1).
- **Large multi-page files.** Elsewhere a drawing set is one PDF — samples up to **~16 MB** and **14 × A1** pages in one file.

Constraints from the use case:

- Signers are **guests** on the Portwood Site — every byte they see or return goes through token-gated Apex.
- The send must work from **Flow** as well as the Signature Sender LWC (the process will be automated).
- The approval must identify **exactly which drawing revision** was approved.

## 2. What exists today (v3.57.0)

| Capability                                 | State                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sign a bare, pre-existing PDF              | **Removed in v3.18, deliberately.** `createRequestFromContentVersion` throws (`DocGenSignatureSenderController.cls:882-895`); `DocGenSignaturePdfFlowAction` ignores `contentVersionId`. This plan does **not** revive it — a signature-tagged template is always required.                                                                                                       |
| Generate a template + append record PDFs   | **Runner only**, "Combine with existing PDFs on this record" (`docGenRunner.js` `_generateMergedPdf` ~`:1291-1320`). Template always first; download or save; not Flow; not signing.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Include record PDFs in a signature request | **Not possible.** Every send path renders the signing document from a template (`createGuidedPdfSignatureRequest`, `DocGenSignatureSenderController.cls:1449`; viewing PDF `Blob.toPdf` at `:1606`, stored as `Source_Document_Id__c` at `:1619`).                                                                                                                                |
| Signature placement                        | Text anchors — `@@SIG-n@@` sentinels found in the PDF.js text layer on **any page** (`DocGenSignaturePdf.page` `locateAnchors` `:1125`, `hitToPdfRect` `:1203`). Placements store no page number. **Extra pages don't break placement.**                                                                                                                                          |
| Finalize (normal path)                     | Client-side pdf-lib composite onto the stored source bytes (`compositeAndFinalize` `:2150`) → `saveCompositedSignedPdf` (`DocGenSignatureController.cls:2692`) stores it as-is. Final hash = SHA-256 of the uploaded bytes.                                                                                                                                                       |
| Finalize (fallback)                        | If the signer has no session marks or the source didn't load, the page calls `saveSignature` (`DocGenSignaturePdf.page` ~`:3173`) → `TemplateSignaturePdfQueueable` **re-renders from the template** (`DocGenSignatureService.cls:1486`, `:1791`). Anything not from the template is dropped. See #407.                                                                           |
| Decline                                    | `declineSignature` (`DocGenSignatureController.cls:1826`) — reason text, status Declined, **no document produced**. Can be hidden org-wide (`Signature_Hide_Decline__c`) or per template (`Hide_Signer_Decline__c`); enforced server-side (#367).                                                                                                                                 |
| Signer form fields                         | text / number / date / checkbox / picklist, written back to the record at completion (`DocGenFieldWritebackService`). Future vehicle for richer outcomes (e.g. "approved as noted").                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Guest file access                          | Guests can't use `/sfc/servlet.shepherd/` URLs (`DocGenSignatureController.cls:2199`); files reach the page as base64 through token-gated remote actions. The legacy path creates a view-only `ContentDistribution` preview (`getOrCreatePublicLink`, `:844`). No `@RestResource` exists in the package.                                                                          |
| PDF libraries                              | `pdflib` static resource (pdf-lib 1.17.1) — already loaded by the signing page (`DocGenSignaturePdf.page:23`). `pdfjs4` (PDF.js 4.7.76) for rendering. The Runner's `docGenPdfMerger.js` is a regex byte-scanner (no object streams, no inherited `/Rotate`/`/CropBox`) — **not suitable for CAD/scanner PDFs**. `DocGenPdfMerger.cls` is Portwood-output-only by its own header. |

## 3. Constraints that shape the design

### 3.1 Size — the dominant constraint

**Measured** (§5.1, §5.2) as an anonymous guest on the Site. Existing endpoints first, then two candidate transports (throwaway spike code, not in this branch):

| Path                                                                | Works up to                          | Fails at | Binding limit                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Existing download `getSourcePdfBase64` (one remote action)          | **5.5 MB** / file                    | 5.75 MB  | VF remoting **response** cap — "exceeded maximum of 15 MB"        |
| Existing upload `saveCompositedSignedPdf` (one remote action)       | **2.95 MB** / call                   | 3.0 MB   | VF remoting **request** cap (~4 MiB of base64) — "Input too long" |
| Candidate T2 — chunked remote-action download (4 MB aligned slices) | **15.85 MB** tested (4 calls, 5.1 s) | —        | none hit; each call re-loads + re-encodes the whole file          |
| Candidate T3 — guest `@RestResource`, raw binary GET                | **15.85 MB** tested (1 call, 1.3 s)  | —        | none hit                                                          |
| Candidate T3 — guest `@RestResource`, raw binary POST               | **16 MB** tested (1 call, 4.0 s)     | —        | none hit                                                          |

**Apex heap is not enforced on these paths in practice.** Documented synchronous heap is 6 MB; measured `Limits.getHeapSize()` reached **38.8 MB** in synchronous Apex (15.85 MB `VersionData` + base64) and **21–42 MB per call** in guest chunked downloads, with no exception. The existing `getSourcePdfBase64` already relies on this for any source above ~2.5 MB. T3 has the smallest footprint (GET ≈ 1× file; POST body not counted — ~7.5 KB). This is undocumented platform behaviour — see Q8.

Consequences:

- **Real drawings exceed the existing single-call download** (6.7, 13 and 16 MB samples) — M1 needs T2 or T3.
- **Upload stays the tight direction for remote actions** (2.95 MB). A single combined signed PDF is not viable over remoting — this drives D1. T3 removes the upload limit, which is what M2 needs.
- `ContentDistribution` download URLs are **CORS-blocked** from the Site page (opaque response), so public links are not a transport for page script.

### 3.2 Other constraints

- **No browser at send time for Flow.** Apex can't merge third-party PDFs, so any combining happens in the **signer's** browser — or not at all (D2).
- **Heavy drawings.** A 14 × A1 AutoCAD file with ~9,200 embedded image tiles takes pdf-lib 2.5 s to load and 8.7 s to copy on a desktop, and PDF.js ~9.5 s **per page** to render (§5.3). Merging dozens of drawings in a phone browser is not viable; rendering needs placeholders and a bounded number of live pages.
- **Legibility.** The signing viewer draws pages at fit-to-width in CSS pixels, ignoring `devicePixelRatio`, with no zoom (#413). At fit-to-width an A1 sheet gets 0.4–1.2 px/mm and an A3 sheet 0.8–2.5 px/mm — drawing text is unreadable. **Zoom that re-renders is an M1 requirement**, not a nice-to-have: a signer can't approve what they can't read.
- **Fallback re-render** (§2) silently loses non-template pages; the page currently fails open (#407).
- **Integrity:** nothing hashes the viewing PDF at send today. An approval must bind the exact drawing revisions.
- **Decline can be hidden** (#367) — an approval request without Decline is only half a sign-off.
- **Managed package rules** (`.claude/skills/managed-package-rules`): new Flow inputs must be `global`; API names are forever; guest `SYSTEM_MODE` reads must be token-keyed; verify in a namespaced org.

## 4. Proposed design decisions (pending RFC)

| #   | Decision                      | Proposal                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| --- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| D1  | Signed output                 | **Approval record**: the template pages + signatures + certificate, where the certificate **lists every attached document** (title, version, SHA-256). The drawings stay on the record untouched. The upload stays small regardless of drawing count or size. A combined "approved pack" is not proposed.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| D2  | Display                       | **No merge.** The signing page shows the template and each drawing as **separate documents in sequence** with an index ("Drawing 3 of 14"); each drawing is fetched and rendered **when opened**, pages rendered lazily. **Zoom re-renders** the visible page at `zoom × devicePixelRatio` (builds on the #413 fix); at high zoom only the visible region is rendered (canvas caps, e.g. iOS ~16.7 MP). Signatures are stamped onto the template bytes as today. pdf-lib merging is not needed in M1. |
| D3  | Transport                     | **Per file, token + index.** Recommended: **T3** — one token-gated guest `@RestResource` (raw binary GET now, POST in M2); one call per drawing, smallest heap. Fallback if a guest REST surface is unacceptable: **T2** chunked remote actions (download only). Send-time caps: per attachment (proposed 20 MB) and per request (proposed 100 files) — to agree.                                                                                                                                     |
| D4  | Identity of what was approved | Pin each attachment by **ContentVersion Id** (`VersionData` is immutable per version) + **SHA-256** computed server-side. Browser re-checks the hash on fetch (defence in depth — the measured browser hash matched the server's).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| D5  | Entry points                  | Signature Sender LWC **and** the Flow action "Portwood: Create Signature Request" take the same thing: an ordered list of file Ids + position (before/after template).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| D6  | Failure mode                  | **Fail closed.** If any attachment can't be fetched or verified, signing is blocked with an actionable message. Both certificate builders (client and server) list the attachments, so even the fallback path produces a record that binds them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| D7  | Scope                         | Single-template requests only in M1. No markup, no packets, no generation-only supplemental PDFs (that's #405 — share the data model and naming with it).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

### 4.1 Data model (proposed — naming to agree with #405)

New child object, working name `DocGen_Signature_Attachment__c` (master-detail → `DocGen_Signature_Request__c`):

| Field                    | Type      | Notes                                 |
| ------------------------ | --------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `Content_Version_Id__c`  | Text(18)  | Pinned version                        |
| `Content_Document_Id__c` | Text(18)  | For display / linking                 |
| `Title__c`               | Text(255) | Snapshot of file title at send        |
| `Version_Number__c`      | Text(20)  | Snapshot of `VersionNumber`           |
| `File_Size__c`           | Number    | Bytes                                 |
| `Sha256__c`              | Text(64)  | Server-computed                       |
| `Position__c`            | Picklist  | `Before` / `After` the template pages |
| `Sort_Order__c`          | Number    |                                       |

A child object (rather than a JSON field on the request) gives FLS, queryability, per-attachment status, dozens of rows without a field-length ceiling, and room for M2 (per-drawing markup output) without reshaping.

### 4.2 Flow of a request

1. **Send** (LWC or Flow) → `createGuidedPdfSignatureRequest` (options/overload TBD) validates each file in `USER_MODE`: sender can read it, it's a PDF, it's **linked to the related record**, size ≤ cap, count ≤ cap. Resolves ContentDocument → latest ContentVersion and pins it, computes SHA-256, inserts attachment rows. Everything else (template render, placements, signers, emails, expiry, verification) is unchanged — single-phase send, no Draft orphans.
2. **Signer opens the link** → init response includes an attachment **manifest** (index, title, version, size, position, sha256 — no record Ids). The page loads the template viewing PDF (existing) and shows the drawing index; each drawing is fetched by **token + index** when opened (server resolves the CV from the request — never client-supplied), hash-checked, and rendered page by page. Anchors are located on the template pages as today.
3. **Approve** → `compositeAndFinalize` stamps onto the template bytes; `addCertificatePage` lists the attachments (multi-page when there are dozens); `saveCompositedSignedPdf` stores the approval record on the related record (unchanged).
4. **Decline** → existing `declineSignature` with reason (unchanged).

## 5. M0 — Spike

Goal: replace estimates with measurements and de-risk real drawings.

- [x] **Samples:** a real issue set — 19 files, 0.5–15.85 MB, A1 + A3, AutoCAD / SOLIDWORKS / Adobe PDF Library. None encrypted, rotated or using object streams; all load in pdf-lib (§5.2). _Still wanted: a scanned drawing._
- [x] **Transport ceilings** — existing endpoints (§5.1), T2 and T3 (§5.2).
- [x] **Merge-for-display:** measured too heavy for large sets (§3.2) → replaced by the per-drawing viewer (D2).
- [x] **Viewer:** PDF.js from the signing page on the real sets, desktop and phone widths, DPR 1 and 3 (§5.3) → zoom-with-re-render required; render cost is content-bound. _Still wanted: timings on a real mid-range phone (the measurements are from a 22-core desktop)._
- [ ] Sender-side SHA-256 at send for a request with many / large files (sync vs a Queueable per file). A single 15.85 MB SHA-256 in synchronous Apex succeeded (§5.2).

### 5.1 M0 results — existing endpoints (2026-09-23)

**Method.** Scratch org built by `scripts/qa/setup-org.sh` conventions (`--no-namespace`; a `portwoodglobal`-namespaced org needs the project Dev Hub — remoting and heap limits are namespace-independent), full `force-app` deploy, a classic Salesforce Site serving `DocGenSignaturePdf` with `DocGen_Guest_Signature` on its guest user. Test files: valid PDFs padded with random (incompressible) bytes to exact sizes, plus a real 4.69 MB drawing, attached to an Account. One `DocGen_Signature_Request__c` + `DocGen_Signer__c` per file with `Source_Document_Id__c` = that file. From an anonymous browser session on the Site, the real `getSourcePdfBase64` and `saveCompositedSignedPdf` were invoked via `Visualforce.remoting.Manager.invokeAction` (`buffer:false`, 120 s timeout).

- Download failures: `Remoting response size exceeded maximum of 15 MB.`
- Upload failures: `Input too long. [1, 149]` — rejected by the platform before Apex runs (signer/request left untouched). 2.95 MB = 4,124,400 base64 chars passed; 3.0 MB = 4,194,304 chars failed.
- Every successful upload was verified server-side: a full-size file on the related record and the request `Signed`.

### 5.2 M0 results — real drawings and candidate transports (2026-09-23)

**Transports** — throwaway spike classes deployed to the scratch org only (key-gated, not in this branch), called from an anonymous session on the Site:

| File     | T2 chunked remote action (4 MB slices) | T3 guest REST GET (binary) |
| -------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| 6.74 MB  | 2 calls, 1.7 s, heap 21 MB/call        | 1 call, 0.5 s, heap 7 MB   |
| 12.95 MB | 4 calls, 4.6 s, heap 36 MB/call        | 1 call, 0.8 s, heap 13 MB  |
| 15.85 MB | 4 calls, 5.1 s, heap 42 MB/call        | 1 call, 1.3 s, heap 16 MB  |

- T3 POST (raw binary upload): 3 / 5 / 8 / 12 / 16 MB all stored **byte-exact** on the related record; 1.4–4.0 s; heap ~7.5 KB.
- Integrity: browser-computed SHA-256 of every reassembled / downloaded file matched the server's SHA-256 of the original.
- Synchronous Apex: loading 15.85 MB `VersionData`, SHA-256 and base64 reached 38.8 MB heap with no exception.
- A `ContentDistribution` `ContentDownloadUrl` fetched from the Site page: `TypeError: Failed to fetch` (CORS); `no-cors` gives an opaque response.

### 5.3 M0 results — viewer (2026-09-23)

**Method.** The signing page's own PDF.js build (`pdfjs4`, loaded from the page's `MODULE_URL`) on the Site, files fetched via the T3 spike endpoint, each page rendered with the page's `fitScale` rule (`min(1.6, (containerWidth − 28) / pageWidth)`, floor 320 px) at the stated device-pixel ratio. `intent: 'print'` was used because the hidden Browser pane pauses `requestAnimationFrame` (display-intent renders stall while hidden). Hardware: a 22-core desktop — phones will be slower.

- **Render time is content-bound, not pixel-bound:** tripling DPR (9× pixels) did not slow any set. Sharp rendering costs memory, not time.
- **Real signing page, phone emulation (Pixel 8, DPR 2):** page-1 canvas backing 320 × 226 in a 320 × 226 CSS box = 640 × 452 physical px → 0.5 backing px per physical px (#413).
- Rough legibility target for 2.5 mm drawing text: ≥ 5 px/mm → an A1 page ≈ 4,200 px wide ≈ 12.5 MP (~50 MB RGBA) — so deep zoom must render the visible region only.

## 6. M1 — Attach record PDFs to a signature request (one PR, after RFC agreement)

### Backend

- [ ] `DocGen_Signature_Attachment__c` + fields + permission sets (Admin/User as appropriate; **no guest object access** — token-keyed `SYSTEM_MODE` only).
- [ ] Send: attachments on the canonical `createGuidedPdfSignatureRequest` (options DTO vs another overload — agree in RFC); validation per §4.2; size + count caps; SHA-256 (sync vs Queueable per file — M0 item).
- [ ] Flow: `DocGenSignatureFlowAction.Request` gains `global` `@InvocableVariable`s `attachedDocumentIds` (`List<String>`, CV or CD Ids) and `attachedDocumentPosition` (`Before` default). Verify in a namespaced org.
- [ ] Guest: manifest on the init response; attachment fetch by **token + index** per D3 (T3 REST GET, or T2 chunked remote action), with the same gates as `getSourcePdfBase64` — token format, `assertSignerReadable`, expiry, terminal state, PIN-verified when required. If T3: `global` REST class, guest class access in `DocGen_Guest_Signature`, namespaced URL (`/services/apexrest/portwoodglobal/...`), no caching headers.
- [ ] Server-path certificate (`DocGenSignatureService` verification block) lists attachments (D6).
- [ ] Coordinate the fail-closed guard with #407.

### Signing page (`DocGenSignaturePdf.page`)

- [ ] Multi-document viewer: template + drawing index; fetch each drawing on open, verify SHA-256 (WebCrypto), render pages lazily; release canvases of drawings not in view.
- [ ] DPR-aware rendering (the #413 fix — land it first, or as part of this PR) and **zoom that re-renders** the visible page (fit / + / − and pinch, debounced; soft render shown until the sharp one lands); visible-region rendering at high zoom.
- [ ] "Rendering…" placeholder with progress for heavy pages (~10 s per page measured on the heaviest sample).
- [ ] Approve available once the signer has opened every drawing? (product decision — see Q9).
- [ ] `addCertificatePage` lists attachments (title, version, SHA-256), paginating for dozens.
- [ ] Fail closed on any attachment error (no silent fallback).

### Sender LWC (`docGenSignatureSender`)

- [ ] Record-PDF picker (reuse `DocGenController.getRecordPdfs`, `:5663`; add size), **select all**, order + before/after, size/count warnings. Keep the change small — #373 is reworking this component.
- [ ] Warn when Decline is hidden on the template/org.

### Tests & gates

- [ ] Apex: send validation (no access, not a PDF, not linked to record, over size/count cap, deleted file); guest IDOR (token A cannot read request B's attachments), index out of range, expired, declined/terminal, PIN not verified; Flow action; certificate content.
- [ ] Content-correctness (signing has none today — see repo `CLAUDE.md` "Subsystem caution"): an end-to-end check that the stored approval PDF's certificate lists every attachment with the right SHA-256, and contains no unresolved `@@SIG-` token (ties to #407).
- [ ] Adversarial guest-security review of the new endpoint(s) — mandatory if T3 (first guest REST surface).
- [ ] `npm run qa`; namespaced pre-flight org (`RunLocalTests`, no perm set assigned); prettier; Code Analyzer.
- [ ] UserGuide section + CHANGELOG entry.

## 7. Guardrails so M1 doesn't box in M2 (markup / redline)

1. **pdf-lib only** for flattening markup (M2) — never the regex merger. M2 needs `/Rotate`/`/CropBox` handling and vector drawing. M1 itself does not merge.
2. **Per-drawing identity is first-class.** M2 marks are keyed to _(attachment, source page)_ in unrotated page space — the D2 viewer already works per drawing.
3. **One transport both ways.** M2 returns a marked-up copy **per drawing** (up to ~16 MB). Remote actions cap uploads at 2.95 MB; T3 POST measured to 16 MB. Choosing T3 in M1 means M2 adds a POST on the same resource; choosing T2 means M2 still needs an upload design.
4. **Vector markup, not raster.** Raster overlays at A1/A3 resolution inflate files (the limit #197 hit).
5. **Pinned CV + SHA-256** lets a marked-up return prove which revision was marked.
6. **Decline produces no document today.** M2's "decline with markup" needs one — don't bake in "decline = no output".
7. `hitToPdfRect` ignores `/Rotate` and `/CropBox` — harmless for M1 (anchors are on template pages), must be fixed for M2.
8. Markup must not write audit rows shaped like signer audits — the certificate maps audits by `Signer__c` and completion back-fills every audit row's hash.

## 8. Open questions for the maintainer

1. **Output (D1):** approval record binding attachments by hash — OK?
2. **Transport (D3) — needed in M1:** a token-gated guest `@RestResource` (T3, recommended — one call per file, also solves M2 uploads) or chunked remote actions (T2, no new surface type, download only)?
3. **Data model:** child object vs JSON field; one model shared with #405's supplemental PDFs? API naming (frozen forever).
4. **API shape:** options DTO for `createGuidedPdfSignatureRequest` vs another overload?
5. **Linkage rule:** require attachments to be linked to the related record (proposed: yes)?
6. **Decline:** block or warn when Decline is hidden on an attachment-bearing request?
7. **#407:** land fail-closed separately first, or as part of M1?
8. **Heap:** both T2 and the existing `getSourcePdfBase64` exceed the documented 6 MB heap on large files without error (§3.1). Comfortable relying on that, or should caps be set to the documented limit?
9. **Caps and review rule:** per-attachment and per-request caps (proposed 20 MB / 100 files)? Require the signer to open every drawing before Approve?

## 9. Out of scope for M1

Markup/redline (M2, separate PR + design); richer outcomes such as "approved as noted" (possible later via a signer picklist form field); packets with attachments; combined-pack output; generation-only supplemental PDFs for Runner/Flow (#405).
